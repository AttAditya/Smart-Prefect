# Smart Prefect

## About Smart Prefect

**Smart Prefect** is a _simple discord bot_ for _managing discord servers_, primarily designed for _educational discord servers_.

Currently it is under development but it provides *many features and services* anyways.

> _This includes creation of managing channels, show word meanings, send messages customized by you for your needs, creating various polls, show random images(just for a little fun purpose) and much more!_

## Prefixes

There are many prefixes for the bot, the common ones include `/`, `\`, `!` and a few more. The generalized prefects are `sp`, `@Smart Prefect` and similar alternatives.

> Prefixes that are available can be seen by using `sp prefixes`

Custom prefixes are currently planned for future and will be add soon.

## Commands

Presenting a complete list of commands might be a bit too much lengthy, instead it is recommended to use the `sp command-names` to check all command names and accordingly using `sp help` to get information about the command individually.

## Future Plans

In future, Smart Prefect is expected to be made smart and better, attaining the prefect qualities.

A wide variety of features are services are planned in future. This also include _Web Based GUI Configuration_ of the bot, don't worry, it sure is a complex name, just to sound good and in reality it means that bot can be customized through the website.

An exact date for update might not be available everytime, the developers of this project are not paid to build this project but rather a side project and as hobby.

Updates however will be posted as a lot is planned for this bot.
